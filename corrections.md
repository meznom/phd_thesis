# Corrections from my committee

Corrections to version 1.0.0.

## Corrections from Frank

* page 4: "and other still have been realized experimentally"
          should be
          "and others still have been realized experimentally"
          [FIXED]
* page 23: eq 2.3, definition of polarization is incorrect
           [FIXED]
* page 29: S should be S^z, for clarity and consistency with chapter 3 (Ising
           approximation)
           [FIXED] (I also removed the hats from the operators, for consistency)


## Corrections from Mark

* page iii (abstract):
    * "cannot retain logic state"
      should be
      "cannot retain logic states" 
      (really?)
    * (?)
* List of symbols, glossary of acronyms (major)
* page 2: "But advances in fabrication technology, ..." --- needs reference
* page 7: It is not clear what reference 42 exactly refers to; it should be made
  clear that reference 42 is the one that argues that decoherence stabilizes QCA
* page 20: 
    * screening depends on doping (which is controllable) (I could mention that)
    * conceivable -> conceivably (Mark says the silicon substrate will for sure
      provide a second tunnelling channel)
    * important: say right here what our model does include and does not
      include; do not leave it vague
* page 24:
    * "Interestingly, time-independent properties were ... and arguably not
      exhaustively" --- reference missing
    * Mark: There is actually a parallel in nanomagnetism, so I'm curious to
      learn omre about this.
* page 28:
    * on the section / the example that ICHA gives wrong result in infinitely
      long wire, Mark: May not have the same problem at finite wire however?
      Does an energy gap open up at long wavelength, like for a (?) wire?
* page 77:
    * important to put a preprint up on the archive, best well before the
      defense (major)
    * at least note that a publication is forthcoming (via a reference, maybe?)
      (major)
    * "which represents binary state as bistable"
      shoud be
      "which represents binary states as bistable"
