# Corrections from my committee

Corrections to version 1.0.0.

## Corrections from Frank

* page 4: "and other still have been realized experimentally"
          should be
          "and others still have been realized experimentally"
          [FIXED]
* page 23: eq 2.3, definition of polarization is incorrect
           [FIXED]
* page 29: S should be S^z, for clarity and consistency with chapter 3 (Ising
           approximation)
           [FIXED] (I also removed the hats from the operators, for consistency)


## Corrections from Mark

* page iii (abstract):
    * "cannot retain logic state"
      should be
      "cannot retain logic states" 
      (really?)
      --- clarified: sentence is missing something; probably should be "a logic
      state"
      [FIXED]
* List of symbols, glossary of acronyms (major) [FIXED]
* page 2: "But advances in fabrication technology, ..." --- needs reference
          [FIXED]
* page 7: It is not clear what reference 42 exactly refers to; it should be made
  clear that reference 42 is the one that argues that decoherence stabilizes QCA
  [FIXED]
* page 20: 
    * screening depends on doping (which is controllable) (I could mention that)
    * conceivable -> conceivably (Mark says the silicon substrate will for sure
      provide a second tunnelling channel)
    * important: say right here what our model does include and does not
      include; do not leave it vague
    [FIXED]
* page 24:
    * "Interestingly, time-independent properties were ... and arguably not
      exhaustively" --- reference missing
    * Mark: There is actually a parallel in nanomagnetism, so I'm curious to
      learn more about this.
    * Clarified: I should put in references, presumably referencing all the
      static characterization work that has been done
      [FIXED]
* page 28:
    * on the section / the example that ICHA gives wrong result in infinitely
      long wire, Mark: May not have the same problem at finite wire however?
      Does an energy gap open up at long wavelength, like for a (?) wire?
      [WON'T FIX]
* page 77:
    * important to put a preprint up on the archive, best well before the
      defense (major)
    * at least note that a publication is forthcoming (via a reference, maybe?)
      (major)
    * "which represents binary state as bistable"
      shoud be
      "which represents binary states as bistable"
    [FIXED]

Corrections for version 1.1.0.


# general comments

Can I make the argument why mean field does not work more concrete?
e.g. Why do we expect mean field to give more ordered states than there really
are?
Lindsay's question: Why is there an artificial phase transition in mean field?
(Kevin: mean field is related / constructed similar to a Ginzburg-Landau theory,
so that's all it really can predict.)


Maybe also: Talk in more detail about order, or no order (e.g. Ising, 1D, 2D,
zero temperature, finite temperature)?


Put in concrete eV values for U, t, etc at the end of the discussion, for
Silicon.

# In 1 versus I_1

I have to either update the text or the figure
